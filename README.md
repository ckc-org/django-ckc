## what's in this

#### `SoftDeletableModel`

Make your models have a `deleted` bool set when they are deleted instead of actuallying 
being deleted. Uses a model manager `SoftDeleteModelManager` to keep them hidden.

#### `DefaultUserCreateMixin` for `ModelSerializers`

This will automatically set `YourModel.created_by` to `request.user`. To override which
attribute the user is written to, add a `user_field` to your classes Meta information

```py
class YourModel(models.Model):
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        

class MySerializer(DefaultUserCreateMixin, ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = YourModel
```

#### `DjangoGeoPointProvider`

Helps generate geo points in Factory Boy factories.

```py
# factories.py
class SomeLocationFactory(DjangoModelFactory):
    location = factory.Faker('geo_point', country_code='US')

    class Meta:
        model = SomeLocation

# test_whatever.py
from django.contrib.gis.geos import Point


class WhateverTest(TestCase):
    def test_something(self):
        SomeLocationFactory()  # random location
        SomeLocationFactory(location=Point(x=60, y=60))  # specified location
```

| command | description|
